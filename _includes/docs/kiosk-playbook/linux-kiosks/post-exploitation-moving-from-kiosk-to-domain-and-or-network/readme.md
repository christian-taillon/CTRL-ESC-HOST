This section focuses on what to do after persistence is in place: discovery, credential access, and lateral movement. It assumes you already have a working shell from the kiosk context.

# Post-Exploitation: Moving from Kiosk to Domain and-or Network

## Objectives

- Identify adjacent systems and internal services reachable from the kiosk segment.
- Determine if the kiosk user context grants elevated privileges or can access cached credentials.
- Establish stable access paths beyond the kiosk endpoint.

## Common Follow-ons

### Discovery

- Enumerate network ranges, internal DNS, and service banners.
- Identify management interfaces, file shares, and directory services.

### Credentials

- Look for local secrets, cached browser credentials, and accessible keychains.
- Check for policy or backup tooling that stores reusable credentials.

### Lateral Movement

- Pivot from the kiosk to internal systems using accessible protocols.
- Use the kiosk user session to test for misconfigured trust paths.

## Operational Notes

- Keep evidence of the initial escape and persistence steps separate from lateral movement findings.
- Map controls that would have prevented the pivot for later hardening guidance.
