This section is for ways to expand reach, when the initial escape leads to a universal pivot point, with many options / when next things to try may not be obvious at first. 

A good example may be, when you have escaped to an app such as Settings, MS Teams, or MS Feedback Hub, and need a pathway of what to try next (without having to exhaustively try every possible option).  

While there are probably multiple pathways to unlock some of these intermediary stages of escape, we have linked to them from the known initial escape flows that make sense.

Only test on your own kiosks and/or with proper written permission and following all appropriate laws and industry ethics / best practices.
