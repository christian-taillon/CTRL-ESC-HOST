## Download LotL Binaries via Browser from Local Host

This test requires the [Escape to Less Restrictive Browser](https://github.com/CroodSolutions/CTRL-ESC-HOST/blob/main/2%20-%20Kiosk%20Playbook/1%20-%20Win11%20Kiosk%20Mode%20-%20Attended%20Access/2%20-%20Next%20Steps/Escape%20to%20Less%20Restrictive%20Browser.md) step first, if the kiosk is running in a Sign or Interactive Display mode.  

This test simply involves typing a local filepath into the browser bar, with the prefix of file:/// at the beginning.

Here are the basic steps to test:
 - Type a filepath in the browser bar, such as file:///C:/Windows/System32/cmd.exe
 - It will then proceed to download the local file via the browser to downloads, if not blocked.
 - Click the folder icon to open the downloads folder.

Now proceed to [Rename LotL or Payload as Msedge](https://github.com/CroodSolutions/CTRL-ESC-HOST/blob/main/2%20-%20Kiosk%20Playbook/1%20-%20Win11%20Kiosk%20Mode%20-%20Attended%20Access/2%20-%20Next%20Steps/Rename%20LotL%20or%20Payload%20as%20Msedge.md)

Remember: Only test on your own kiosks and/or with proper written permission and following all appropriate laws and industry ethics / best practices
