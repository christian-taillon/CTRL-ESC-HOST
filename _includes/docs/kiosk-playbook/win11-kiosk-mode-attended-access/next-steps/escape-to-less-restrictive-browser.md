## Escape to Less Restrictive Browser 

Win11 Attended Access can be setup in two modes for MS Edge Kiosk:
 - Kiosk for Digital Sign or Interactive Display
 - Kiosk for use as a Public Browser

In the former case, MS Edge is in a fullscreen mode, without a browser bar to interact with, preventing some types of further testing. The main idea is to find some type of dialog box, with a link that will open in a less locked down browser context (still kiosk restrictions, but able to interact with more of the browser).

Here are a few simple options that we have confirmed work, but there are many so this is not exhaustive:

Step 1: Open settigns using Win+A or Win+"+" to open Settings.
Step 2: Try any of the following:
 - Apps > Actions > "Learn how to get started with Actions"
 - Personalization > Help with Background > Click any of the links below this heading.
 - Time & Language > "Opening Dictation Toolbar" link at the bottom.
 - Gaming > "More about Game Mode"

You get the idea. There are a lot of these pathways. Microsoft has directly blocked several such as the Get help link, but many are open pathways to a more normal looking browser. 

From here, your next testing step is:
 - Download LotL Binaries via Browser from Local Host
 - Download LotL Binaries or Payload from the Web 

Remember: Only test on your own kiosks and/or with proper written permission and following all appropriate laws and industry ethics / best practices
