While hacking kiosks may be fun, the real value is looking for scenarios where a kiosk may introduce a noteworthy foothold into an environment, bridging from a low trust zone to a higher trust context.  

Here are a few key scenarios to consider:

 - Kiosk joined to an Active Directory domain that is important (or w/ high risk domain trusts).
 - Any kiosk that is on a network with access to other sensitive systems or information.
 - A kiosk that has credentials or service accounts overlapping with important assets.
 - Kiosks that process financial/sensitive information that could leak such information to an adversary.  


One scenario we want to find and fix in the world, are signage or other kiosks that are in semi-public areas, but pulling data from a sensitive network (e.g., OT), in a way that could be a bridge for attackers to threaten critical infrastructure.   

For this section, we provide resources and next steps for how to test for the real risk exposure of a kiosk once you have escaped to host, including where this flows into more traditional penetration testing (Beacons/C2, RMM, AD-audits, network recon, and more).  

Only test on your own kiosks and/or with proper written permission and following all appropriate laws and industry ethics and best practices.
