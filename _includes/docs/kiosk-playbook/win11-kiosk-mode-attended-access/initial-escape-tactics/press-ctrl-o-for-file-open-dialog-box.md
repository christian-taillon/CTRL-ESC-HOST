## Press Ctrl+O for File Open Dialog Box

If not specifically locked down, it is possible to invoke the File Open dialog box, via the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+O.

Press Ctrl+O and then proceed to these secondary tactics:

 - [Launch Terminal from File Open Dialog Box via Preview Pane](https://github.com/CroodSolutions/CTRL-ESC-HOST/blob/main/2%20-%20Kiosk%20Playbook/1%20-%20Win11%20Kiosk%20Mode%20-%20Attended%20Access/2%20-%20Next%20Steps/Launch%20Terminal%20from%20File%20Open%20Dialog%20Box%20via%20Preview%20Pane.md)
 - [Rename LotL or Payload as Msedge](https://github.com/CroodSolutions/CTRL-ESC-HOST/blob/main/2%20-%20Kiosk%20Playbook/1%20-%20Win11%20Kiosk%20Mode%20-%20Attended%20Access/2%20-%20Next%20Steps/Rename%20LotL%20or%20Payload%20as%20Msedge.md)

While some of these are easier and more streamlined than others and they all work on Attended Access presenting Edge as of this writing, individual host-hardening policies may apply, and these could vary from one organization to the next (for penetration testers). 

Note that the File Open dialog box seems to offer quite a bit more attack surface, when compared with the File Save dialog box. 

Remember: Only test on your own kiosks and/or with proper written permission and following all appropriate laws and industry ethics / best practices.
