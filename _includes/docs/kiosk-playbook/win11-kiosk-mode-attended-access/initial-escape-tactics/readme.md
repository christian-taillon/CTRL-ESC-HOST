This section is to provide a range of tactics that you can try for getting initial kiosk breakout from Windows 11 Attended Access / Single App Kiosk Mode.

This is where you will get your first dialog box or starting point, after which, there will be links to the later sections describing what to do/test for next.  

At the time of writing, all of the tactics included here worked on at least some implementations of Attended Access, although many additional polices may have been applied in mature organizations, either limiting these escape options, and/or limiting the downstream pathways for each flow.  A few of the less elegant solutions were in response to aggressive hardening measures taken by some such more mature implementations.  

Only test on your own kiosks and/or with proper written permission and following all appropriate industry ethics and best practices.
