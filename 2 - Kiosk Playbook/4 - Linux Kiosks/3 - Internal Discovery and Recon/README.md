## Introduction and Overview

So, you managed to get a shell on a Linux kiosk. Now what?

In a typical penetration test, you'd transfer tools like LinPEAS or a C2 beacon (e.g., Sliver or Cobalt Strike). However, kiosk engagements often have a smaller scope and tighter rules. When an administrator asks, "So what?", you need quick answers without complex tooling.

These simple, few-character oneliners allow you to quickly understand:
 - What network(s) is the host on and what can it reach?
 - Is it joined to an Active Directory domain or LDAP?
 - What services and interesting software are running?

**Key Point**: This guide is not a replacement for comprehensive tools. It's meant for quick, high-level recon using built-in Linux commands to answer basic questions in minutes.

## Basic Recon 

Most of these commands are standard on almost all Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, CentOS). 

### Basic Host Info

 - `uname -a` (kernel version and architecture)
 - `hostnamectl` (OS version, architecture, and virtualization info)
 - `cat /etc/*release` (detailed OS and version information)
 - `hostname`
 - `whoami`
 - `id` (shows UID, GID, and group memberships)
 - `groups`
 - `env` (check for interesting environment variables like `KIOSK_USER` or `DISPLAY`)

**Note**: If an EDR blocks `whoami` or `id`, try reading `/etc/passwd` directly: `grep $(whoami) /etc/passwd`.

### Passive Network Discovery

 - `ip addr` (all network interfaces and IP addresses)
 - `ip route` (view the routing table)
 - `ip neighbor` (equivalent to `arp -a`, shows the ARP cache)
 - `ss -tulnp` (list listening ports and associated processes; requires sudo for process names)
 - `netstat -rn` (routing table in classic format)
 - `cat /etc/resolv.conf` (DNS servers)
 - `cat /etc/hosts` (local host mappings)
 - `nmcli device show` (NetworkManager details, if available)

### Basic Account and Policy Enumeration

 - `cat /etc/passwd` (list all local users)
 - `getent passwd` (list all users, including those from AD/LDAP if joined)
 - `sudo -l` (check what commands the current user can run with sudo)
 - `last` (list last logged-in users)
 - `grep sudo /etc/group` (list users in the sudo/admin group)
 - `cat /etc/sudoers` (if readable, shows sudo policies)
 - `ls -l /etc/sudoers.d/`
 - `realm list` (check if the host is joined to an AD domain via SSSD)
 - `wbinfo -u` (list domain users if using Winbind)

## Identify Running / Interesting Software and Services

 - `ps aux` (list all running processes)
 - `top -n 1` (snapshot of running processes and system load)
 - `systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running` (list active systemd services)
 - `service --status-all` (list status of all services in older SysV init systems)
 - `ls -l /etc/systemd/system/` (list custom systemd service files)
 - `dpkg -l` (list installed packages on Debian/Ubuntu)
 - `rpm -qa` (list installed packages on RHEL/CentOS)
 - `ls /opt` (often contains third-party kiosk or management software)
 - `ps aux | grep -i "kiosk\|chrome\|firefox"` (identify the kiosk application itself)

## Mapped Drives and Reachable Shares

 - `lsblk` (list block devices and mount points)
 - `mount | column -t` (show all mounted filesystems in a readable format)
 - `df -h` (disk space usage and mount points)
 - `cat /etc/fstab` (static filesystem information and network mounts)
 - `smbclient -L localhost -N` (list local Samba shares, if smbclient is installed)
 - `showmount -e <IP>` (check for NFS exports on adjacent hosts)

## Examine Scheduled Tasks

 - `crontab -l` (list cron jobs for the current user)
 - `ls -R /etc/cron*` (list system-wide cron jobs)
 - `systemctl list-timers` (list systemd timers, the modern equivalent of cron)
 - `cat /etc/anacrontab`

## Active Sessions

 - `who` (who is currently logged in)
 - `w` (what users are doing)
 - `last -a` (last logins with hostnames)
 - `lastlog` (reports the most recent login of all users)

## Kiosk-Specific Enumeration

 - `cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager` (check which display manager is used, e.g., GDM, LightDM)
 - `ls /usr/share/xsessions` (available desktop sessions)
 - `cat ~/.xsession-errors` (might contain clues about kiosk app crashes or configs)
 - `ps aux | grep X` (identify the X server and its arguments)

## Resources and References for Privelege Escalation

For Linux, Privelege Escalation attacks have a high research cost to find, and tend to get fixed quickly once found. However, it seems likely that there are probably obstacles with patching for at least some Linux kiosks, so it is worth testing recent PEs to see what works. While it is out of scope for this repo to track trending and emerging PE attacks, we will occasionally add some you may try:
